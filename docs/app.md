# Web viewer

React + TypeScript + Vite + OpenSeadragon, managed with `bun`.
Identical structure to the NYC viewer; only the title strings,
default DZI path, and attribution overlay change.

Required attribution overlay in the viewer chrome. The viewer ships the
required minimum (OSM + Geoportal Berlin) **plus** the Wikimedia visual-
reference clause, because the bundled tiles use Wikimedia references
(see `NOTICE.md`). This is the exact string in `src/app/src/App.tsx`
(`ATTRIBUTION`); keep the two in sync, and never drop the leading
OSM + Geoportal Berlin minimum:

```
© OpenStreetMap contributors · 3D building models: Geoportal Berlin (dl-de/zero-2-0) · Visual references: Wikimedia Commons/Wikipedia
```

When Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles are enabled (opt-in), additionally
show the Google attribution required by the Google Maps Platform Terms.

## Keyboard shortcuts & help

The viewer has a built-in help panel (the keyboard button in the top
toolbar, or press `?`) listing the shortcuts: `←`/`→` previous/next
landmark, `Space` start/pause the tour, `+`/`=`/`−` zoom, `Home`/`0`
overview, `L` copy a view link, `Esc` close overlays.

Mouse users can Shift-drag horizontally for continuous rotation while ordinary
drag remains pan. On touch screens one finger pans and a two-finger gesture
combines pinch zoom, pan and twist rotation. At phone widths the landmark rail
starts closed, opens from the list icon, closes after selection and leaves the
safe-area-aware bottom control strip available without covering the map.

The downloadable `START-HERE.html` uses a separate zero-server camera. It
normalizes the 16384×11616 landmark payload into the 2157×1529 SVG overlay
coordinate system, applies an invertible pan/scale/skew/rotate transform, keeps
the stage centre stable through zoom and swivel, and constrains the transformed
corners so the map cannot be lost completely outside the viewport. Desktop
stage height is fixed to the viewport; below 850 px the map uses 58dvh and the
controls scroll independently in the remaining 42dvh.

## Shareable view links

The link button in the top toolbar copies the current landmark,
orientation, and mirror state into the URL hash. Opening that URL restores
the same landmark focus and view orientation, which makes local QA notes
and screenshot handoff easier without needing server-side routes.

## Landmark tour order

The viewer sorts `landmarks.json` into a north-to-south Regierungsviertel
walk before rendering the rail and tour. The source coordinates are not
moved; only the user-facing order changes. See
[`correctness-crosscheck.md`](correctness-crosscheck.md).

For local download reliability, the same landmark payload is also bundled
into the React app at `src/app/src/data/regierungsviertel-landmarks.json`.
Keep it byte-identical to
`src/app/public/dzi/regierungsviertel/landmarks.json`; the package tests
enforce this. Bundling avoids `fetch()` for downloaded `file://` starts.

## Remote DZI hosting

By default the viewer loads the DZI tile pyramid and reference map from
the bundled `public/dzi/regierungsviertel/`, while the DZI geometry and
landmark navigation are bundled into the app to support double-click
local starts. Set `VITE_DZI_BASE_URL` at build time to load the tile
pyramid and reference map from a remote host (e.g. a Cloudflare R2
bucket) instead — see
[`perplexity-hosting.md`](perplexity-hosting.md).
